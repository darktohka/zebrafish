	  A small SSH 2 server designed for small memory environments.

	  Note that dropbear requires a per-device unique host key. The
	  key will be generated when dropbear starts, but it is not
	  persistent over reboot (if you have a read-only rootfs) or
	  upgrade (if you have a read-write rootfs). To make the key
	  persistent, replace /etc/dropbear with a symlink to a
	  directory on a persistent, writeable filesystem.
	  Alternatively, mount a persistent unionfs over your root
	  filesystem.
